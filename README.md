# Sequential-vs-Mutitasking

This experiment compared the impact of normal and ancillary activities on the performance of an individual while executing the primary task. 
The main objective is to find how multitasking affects the performance of people, as compared to completing the tasks sequentially.

The effect of sequential task was found to be significantly different than multitasking. 
Even though some of the study subjects performed better while multitasking, thus indicating the potential for a slight learning 
factor to perform faster than their previous time but they had a greater number of errors in their writing and counting compared to the other students.

However, the overall trend for the experiment showed that the students performed overall slower during the multitasking run compared to the sequential one. 
In fact, the study showed that on average, students took 24% longer to complete the task by multitasking than sequential. 
Thus, putting into question whether students should be multitasking to complete their assignments.
